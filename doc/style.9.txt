NAME
----

style - kernel coding style and rules

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This document describes the preferred coding style, a close variant of
the modern K&R style, for the X15 kernel. It probably does not encompass
all the rules, which are quite numerous despite efforts to keep them
simple and compact. As a result, developers should compare their work
against existing recent modules and infer the rules that may not be
mentioned here. If you identify multiple rules that seem to conflict,
assume any of them is valid. If in doubt, make a pragmatic decision
and move forward.

LANGUAGES
---------

The kernel is mostly written in the C programming language, conforming
to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99) and slowly transitioning to ISO/IEC 9899:2011
(C11), with GNU extensions. While many GNU extensions are used, nested
functions are forbidden. They are considered too specific to the GCC
compiler. Note that X15 can currently be built with both GCC and Clang,
and the latter has no support for nested functions. Also note that the
kernel only expects the freestanding C environment from the compiler.

Since X15 is low level system software, processor-specific assembly is
inevitable. Developers should always refrain from writing assembly code
when possible. Obviously, that code must only be used in
architecture-specific modules.

LINES
-----

Lines are normally limited to 80 columns, unless there is a compelling
reason not to. This makes it easy to identify code with too many levels
of indentation, and also allows viewing multiple buffers side-by-side
on small screens, which happens to also be comfortable on larger screens.

When defining a function, always break the line right before its name,
so that qualifiers and the return type are on their own line. As a
result, there is enough space for arguments even when the function
name is long. It also makes functions easier to find with grep.

Use at most one empty line as a separator. Use empty lines around
functions and blocks, and also when you consider it appropriate
inside blocks, e.g. to isolate critical sections, and/or locking
functions.

COMMENTS
--------

Each source file must start with a copyright statement comment,
followed by a description of the file, unless the content is simple
and obvious enough not to need one. The copyright statement and the
description must be separated by two empty comment lines :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
 * Copyright (c) 2017 John Smith.
 *
 * This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * etc...
 *
 *
 * Description of the module.
 */
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments are written in C style, not C++. Here are a few examples :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Most single-line comments look like this */

/*
 * Multi-line comments look like this. They should also be used for
 * "reference" descriptions in public headers.
 */
struct dummy {
    int useless;    /* Here is a way to provide short member descriptions */
    char moot;      /* But don't hesitate to move descriptions above members
                       when they spawn too many lines on the right side. */
};

/*
 * Instead of using C comments to disable code blocks, use the #if 0
 * preprocessor directive. Remember that C comments do not nest.
 */
#if 0
...
#endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments should not be abused. A large number of comments creates noise
that readers must filter. Instead of writing a comment, ask yourself
whether you can improve the meaning of the code itself, e.g. by changing
names or breaking the code into smaller functions with names that are
good enough to convey the message of the comment. Prefer to describe data
over code. Comments in the code must point at details that are important
and not obvious, and quality code should have few of those.

Note that the project does not use an annotation format for documentation
generation such as Doxygen, because, despite the undeniable improvement over
other types of tools, the benefit still seems too small considering the
additional rules that developers must keep in mind, the effort spent on
checking the annotations and the duplication that they may cause, and the
actual use of the generated documentation compared to direct source code
browsing.

INDENTATION
-----------

An indentation level is 4 spaces. It is strongly recommended, although
not compulsory, to avoid using more than 3 indentation levels. More
levels are tolerated for very short blocks. Combining 4 spaces per level
with 80 columns allows the use of somewhat long, significant names, and
naturally warns that a function should be simplified when the code becomes
overly crammed to the right.

Tabulation characters are forbidden in source files, and should only be
used in Makefiles where absolutely required. This allows everyone to get
the same view, whatever the editor used.

In a switch statement, the case labels are aligned on the same column as
the switch statement :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
switch (var) {
case VAL1:
    do_one_thing();
    break;
case VAL2:
case VAL3:
    do_another();
    break;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When conditions don't fit on a single line, break before operators,
and indent the new line on the same column as the associated condition.
Use parentheses to make precedence explicit, even when not strictly needed.
Here is an example :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static void
do_something(void)
{
    if (overly_long_stupid_condition_name_that_you_shouldn_t_use
        && another_overly_long_stupid_condition_name
        && (yet_another_variable_with_an_overly_long_name
            || (a_first_long_variable_name != a_second_long_variable_name))) {
        return;
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One reason for those rules is to make reviews easier, by pushing code as much
to the left as possible. The code should allow superficial reviews by just
taking a quick look at the left side of the code, e.g. control statements,
most conditions, operators, function names, their first parameter, etc...
A line which reaches the right side marks a spot that may need more careful
review.

Don't write multiple statements on a single line.

BRACES
------

Opening braces are written at the end of lines containing control statements
or struct/union/enum definitions. Closing braces are written on the same
column as their associated control statement. Opening braces for functions
are written on their own line after the arguments. Braces must also be used
for single-line blocks, as this reduces both efforts when adding debugging
code in such blocks and risks when merging conflicting code. In cases of
multi-part statements, closing braces are written before the continuation.
Here is an example :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void
do_something(void *arg)
{
    if (arg == NULL) {
        return;
    } else {
        print_what_it_is(arg);
    }

    do {
        play_with(arg);
    } while (can_play_with(arg));
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main reason for this style is that it allows line compression with
almost no loss of readability, since it is easy to identify where blocks
start.

SPACES
------

Spaces are used around most keywords. The exceptions are sizeof, typeof,
alignof, and pass:[__attribute__], because of their similarity with
functions. These exceptions must be used with parentheses. Spaces are also
used around operators, except unary operators. For example :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if (!skip_copy && (a != b)) {
    memcpy(&a, &b, sizeof(a));
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When declaring pointer variables, use a space before "`*`", but not after,
so that the "`*`" character and the variable name are adjacent. The main
reason is that, while pointers are variables, with a type of their own,
they are a special kind of variables, that deserve more attention. Another
is to reduce mistakes when declaring several variables on the same line.
On the other hand, when writing functions returning pointers, use spaces
both before and after "`*`". The reason is to always clearly separate
returned types from the function name. Here is an example :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static struct my_type * my_function(struct my_type *var);

/* ... */

static struct my_type *
my_function(struct my_type *var)
{
    struct my_type *a, tmp;

    a = do_something(var, &tmp);
    return a;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't leave trailing spaces at the end of lines.

NAMES
-----

First of all, use underscores instead of camel case to separate words in
compound names. Function and variable names are in lower case. Macro
names generally are in upper caser, except for macros which behave strictly
like functions, which could be replaced with inline functions with no
API change.

There are two ways to name symbols, depending on whether they're global
or not. Global symbols, either private (declared static) or public
(part of the publically exposed interface), must always be prefixed with
the namespace of the module they belong to. This makes it easy to know
that 1/ a symbol is global and 2/ where to find it in the project. It also
makes it possible to move definitions between the opaque implementation
and header files with few diffs. Names for local variables should be
short, with no prefix, since prefixes are used to add context, whereas
local variables are confined to the current context.

When a module defines an object type, the type name immediately follows
the module name. Functions applying to objects (methods) are named by
adding the method name to the object type name. The name of helper
functions and methods is simply added at the end of the main function
that calls them.

Here are some examples :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
 * Object type "cpu_pool" of module "kmem".
 */
struct kmem_cpu_pool;

/*
 * Method "init" of object type "cpu_pool" of module "kmem".
 */
static void kmem_cpu_pool_init(struct kmem_cpu_pool *cpu_pool,
                               struct kmem_cache *cache);

/*
 * Object type "cache" of module "kmem".
 */
struct kmem_cache;

/*
 * Helper function "verify" of method "alloc" of object type "cache" of
 * module "kmem".
 */
static void kmem_cache_alloc_verify(struct kmem_cache *cache, void *buf,
                                    int construct);

/*
 * Method "alloc" of object type "cache" of module "kmem".
 */
void *
kmem_cache_alloc(struct kmem_cache *cache)
{
    struct kmem_cpu_pool *cpu_pool;
    int filled, verify;
    void *buf;

    /* ... */;
}

/*
 * Function "info" of module "kmem".
 */
void kmem_info(void);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently one exception to the naming rules, which is the
module:arch/param module. The only API changes allowed on this module
are removals, in order to move certain symbols where they should be,
and renames using the param namespace, for symbols that actually belong
to the module.

FUNCTIONS
---------

Functions should do one thing, and do it well. Their name should be
carefully chosen to best reflect their operation. Ideally, functions
should be short enough to fit in a "page", i.e. not much more than
25 lines. The real metric developers should use to decide whether to
break a function or not is the number of variables, including parameters.
Assuming most people can remember around 5 things at the same time, you
should break functions when the number of variables gets higher than
this value. Variables such as a buffer pointer and its size can be
considered a single variable.

Do not hesitate to break functions up when things get even slightly
complicated. If that helps, remember that static functions can easily
be inlined by the compiler, even without the inline keyword. Link-time
optimizations (LTO) improve the situation further by considering the
whole program as a single compilation unit.

Always name arguments in function prototypes.

Common call protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions should match one of the following call protocols :

type get_value(...)::
  Accessor with no side effect.
void do_something(...)::
  Function that cannot fail.
struct my_struct * my_struct_get(...)::
  Function that returns an object, or NULL if an error occurred.
int do_something(...)::
  Function that returns an error code, unless stated otherwise.

It's easy to know when to return an object, or an error and the
object through a pointer argument : if there is a single possible
error code, let a NULL value encode that error, otherwise return
it explicitely :

struct my_struct * my_struct_create(...)::
  Return NULL if an error occurs, which may only be ERROR_NOMEM.
int my_struct_create(struct my_struct **my_structp, ...)::
  Return an error (ERROR_NOMEM or something else) if creation fails,
  otherwise pass the new object to the caller through the double pointer
  argument and return 0.

Methods, which are functions invoked on an object instance, must be
defined so that their first argument is always the object instance
on which the method is invoked.

Unconditional branch statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developers are encouraged to use unconditional branches in cases where
they contribute to maintaining complexity low. Such cases include return
on invalid argument, breaking or continuing simple loops, and centralized
error handling. Note that this includes the *goto* statement. The rationale,
beyond making error handling code common, is to keep the indentation level
low. The main code flow, with the lowest indentation level, should match
the most likely case. The compiler often uses heuristics based on keywords
such as *return* or *goto* which are applied to the conditions of the
containing block. You may also use the *likely* and *unlikely* macros
to give hints about branches to the compiler in performance critical
paths.

Here is an example for object creation :

[source,c]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static int
obj_create(struct obj **objp, int var)
{
    struct subobj *subobj;
    struct obj *obj;
    int error;

    obj = kmem_cache_alloc(&obj_cache);

    if (obj == NULL) {
        return ERROR_NOMEM;
    }

    error = subobj_create(&subobj);

    if (error) {
        goto error_subobj;
    }

    error = obj_check_var(var);

    if (error) {
        goto error_var;
    }

    obj_init(obj, subobj, var);
    *objp = obj;
    return 0;

error_var:
    subobj_destroy(subobj);
error_subobj:
    kmem_cache_free(&obj_cache, obj);
    return error;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common functions and methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following list can be used to easily find appropriate standard names
for the most common operations.

*bootstrap*::
  This function is used for early module initialization. It should only
  exist if initialization must be broken down into multiple steps. If
  there is a single initialization step, run it in the *setup* function.
*setup*::
  This function is used for module initialization.
*init*::
  Object initialization, without memory allocation. Object initialization
  should normally never fail.
*create*::
  Object creation, including both allocation and initialization.
*destroy*::
  Object destruction.
*ref*::
  Add a reference to an object.
*unref*::
  Remove a reference from an object, destroying it if there are no more
  references.
*acquire* or *lock*::
  Acquire exclusive access to an object.
*release* or *unlock*::
  Release exclusive access to an object.
*add*::
  Add an object to a container.
*remove*::
  Remove an object from a container.
*lookup*::
  Look up an object in a container.
